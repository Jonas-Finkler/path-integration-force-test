# Path Integration Force Test

Test routine to check if the energy derivatives (forces) and lattice derivatives (stress) are correctly implemented.  
The test integrates the derivatives along a path such that they can be compared to the direct energy calculation.  

See `main.py` for instructions on how to use it.

Install with pip (pip install .)
